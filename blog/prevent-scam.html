                          Good day guys, this is another article from me. Okay,
                          let me rephrase, this is yet another medium to pass an
                          information across, yeah let's get into it. I keep
                          getting a lot of feedbacks from friends, family and
                          random people on social media, saying they have been
                          hacked, well we have a lot of scammers out there
                          stealing people's private information to impersonate
                          them, and maybe ruin their lives on social media doing
                          despicable things with their accounts 😑. I have
                          articulated few things you can look out for when going
                          about your normal routines like checking emails,
                          following up links or visiting random websites. Here
                          you go:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                          Try preventing phishing by all means.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p class="mb-30">
                          What is Phishing? According to Merriam Webster
                          dictionary:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                          A scam by which an email user is duped into revealing
                          personal or confidential information which the scammer
                          can use illicitly
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="mb-30">
                          Mostly, phishing happens from the emails you get
                          randomly most of the time, black hat hackers appear
                          lying to be trusted companies to launch this attacks.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                          Let me give you a formulated scenario If I was a black
                          hat hacker, I'll randomly do footprinting on my prey (
                          random innocent people ), by getting all the
                          information i need from google by searching either
                          using your image or your full name, google will extend
                          my curiosity to other websites like facebook, twitter,
                          instagram etc. I'll say google is innocent, because it
                          is a search engine, so it has an algorithm in place to
                          look for every occurrence of your image or full name
                          all over www (world wide web), so after finally
                          picking facebook, because I know you're regular on
                          there, I could see your recent post it is only just 5
                          hrs ago, so i went to your about profile page and
                          copied your email address from there, I cloned
                          facebook using “setoolkit” on kali linux distribution,
                          it is very easy like pretty easy to even do a massive
                          email scam from there, from there i can as well clone
                          the facebook page i need, and send an harvester to
                          your email address ( a facebook login page only ),
                          coming back to your mail you just all of a sudden
                          carelessly clicked on the link from an intruder using
                          facebook to lie, telling you to login, so you just
                          followed the link using your browser to login, then it
                          redirects you to the real Facebook 😮. Do you know
                          what just happened 😂, you've just given your facebook
                          password to the hacker, you just did it, all by
                          yourself 🙄. The hacker did not crack facebook
                          directly to pull your details, but cracked you to
                          snitch ✍. I'll have to check the harvest from the
                          harvester, just like that, I have your email address
                          already then your password all of a sudden.

                          I’m not the hacker here😂, please try to recognize the
                          fact that this is a formulated scenario 🙌🏾🙏🏾 When the
                          hacker gets it, he changes the email immediately, and
                          then your password, because he has it 👀, yes you gave
                          it out, this is just a technique, they have many ideas
                          to launch attacks than you think they don’t. Ofcourse
                          let me remind you, you cannot change your password
                          back by using forgot password method, because your
                          active email address has also been changed too. Let me
                          give you few solutions .

                          don’t follow the instructions. Check the domain name
                          in your browser, before you

                          And is it secured? ) . Google it and ask questions.
                          Better still, if you’re curious enter a wrong
                          password, the hacker don’t have the luxury to obtain
                          the database from facebook to check if your password
                          is correct or not, so if you enter a wrong password
                          you will not be seeing a try again
                          page 🤔, you had better leave that page immediately.

                          make sure your data is going through a secured website
                          using this protocols. Yes, the hacker can still
                          intercept this connections using MITM attack ( man in
                          the middle ), I am not ready to go into
                          details with MITM, because it is also a form to steal
                          your personal data from you. But if you use a secured
                          connection it will be encrypted, so making your data
                          useless to the hacker. Making use of HTTP only without
                          a S, is like being a soldier, going to war without a
                          weapon, now when your enemy sees you, he can decide
                          what to do with you, either killing you, injuring you
                          or letting you go, but why would you put all your fate
